Qian Zheng is currently a Research Fellow at the [Rapid-Rich Object Search Lab](https://rose.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/Home.aspx) (directed by [Prof. Alex Chichung Kot](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/eackot/) and [Prof. Wen Gao](http://www.jdl.ac.cn/htm-gaowen/index_en.htm)), School of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and works with [Prof. Boxin Shi](http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~shiboxin/) and [Prof. Xudong Jiang](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/exdjiang/).
His research interests are computational photography (camera calibration, reflection removal) and computer vision (reflectance and illumination modeling, 3D vision).

Before joining NTU, he earned his Ph.D. degree in computer science and technology from Zhejiang University (ZJU) in 2017 under the supervision of [Prof. Gang Pan](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/gpan).
During his Ph.D. study, he visited the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) with a ZJU-PolyU joint supervision scheme under the supervision of [Prof. Ajay Kumar](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csajaykr/) (Nov. 2012 - Nov.2013, Aug. 2015 - Jun. 2016).
He got his Bachelor of Engineering from Zhejiang University in 2011.
